## Random Walk Algorithms

This homework focuses on utilizing random walk techniques to solve the described problem in HW3. The primary tasks involve analyzing user interactions and making recommendations based on these interactions. The tasks are outlined as follows:

### Objectives

1. **Graph Analysis**:
    - Determine what information nodes (users) and edges (interactions) provide within the graph.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
    - Implement the proposed algorithm to identify users with similar interactions and recommend them to each other.
    - Select users and use the random walk algorithm to suggest other users they might be interested in.
    - Compare the recommendations generated by random walk algorithms to those from previous exercises to see if they are consistent.

3. **Evaluation**:
    - Assess how the algorithm performs in both online and offline contexts.
    - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using random walk algorithms in this context.
